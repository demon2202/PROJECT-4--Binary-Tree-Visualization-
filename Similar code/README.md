🌳🔍 Binary Search Tree & AVL Tree Visualizer 👀

Welcome to the Binary Search Tree & AVL Tree Visualizer! This is a web application built using React that allows users to visualize Binary Search Trees (BST) and AVL Trees interactively.

⭐ Features

This application offers the following features:

🌳 Visual Representation of BST & AVL Trees

➕ Insertion of nodes into the tree

🗑️ Deletion of nodes from the tree

🤖 Automatic Balancing in AVL trees

🔄 Tree Traversals:

🟢 Inorder Traversal (Left, Root, Right)

🔵 Preorder Traversal (Root, Left, Right)

🔴 Postorder Traversal (Left, Right, Root)

🟡 Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First Search)

🎭 Graphical Representation of trees using SVG

🖥️ User-Friendly Interface with interactive controls

🛠️ Technologies Used

This project is built using:

⚛️ React – Frontend framework for interactive UI

📜 JavaScript (ES6+) – Core programming language

🎨 CSS – Styling for the user interface

🖼️ SVG – Used for rendering tree structures

📥 Installation & Setup

🎮 How to Use

This application provides an intuitive interface for interacting with BST & AVL trees:

Insert Nodes ➕

Enter a number in the input field and click Insert to add a node.

Delete Nodes 🗑️

Enter a number and click Delete to remove a node.

Visualize Traversals 🔄

Click on any traversal button (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order) to see the tree traversal in action.

Switch Between BST & AVL 🔁

Toggle between Binary Search Tree (BST) and AVL Tree using the mode switch.
